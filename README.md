# WebService

Webservice listens for organization events to know when a repository has been created. When the repository is created:

1. automate the protection of the master branch. 
2. Notify yourself with an @mention in an issue within the repository that outlines the protections that were added

## Repository Structure
All updates should be made in the following directories.

### src
All source code required to build the application.

### utils
Helpful scripts

## Known issues / feature backlog
The following are a list of known issues or desired features, and should prioritized for future work:

1. Assumption is new repo includes a "main" branch.  Need to check if branch exists; if not, create one.
2. Using a PAT for authentication / authorization.  Improve authentication / authorization.
3. Hardcoded org name of 'WyckoffCo'
4. Webhook was manually created.  Build script to create webhook for org.
